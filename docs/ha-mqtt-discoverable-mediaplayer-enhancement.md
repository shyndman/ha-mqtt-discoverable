# ha-mqtt-discoverable MediaPlayer Implementation Status

## Current Implementation Summary

The `MediaPlayerInfo`/`MediaPlayer` implementation has been successfully implemented with property-based state management. The implementation follows the framework's design patterns and provides an intuitive API for managing media player entities in Home Assistant via MQTT discovery.

## Implementation Overview

The MediaPlayer implementation follows the framework's established patterns, providing a clean property-based API.

### MediaPlayerInfo Structure

Located in `ha_mqtt_discoverable/media_player.py`, the `MediaPlayerInfo` class defines:

1. **State Properties**: Actual media player state (title, artist, volume, etc.)
2. **Feature Support Flags**: Boolean flags indicating supported capabilities
3. **Automatic Topic Generation**: Topics are generated automatically based on enabled features

### MediaPlayer Class Features

The `MediaPlayer` class provides:

1. **Property-based State Management**: Methods like `set_title()`, `set_volume()`, etc.
2. **Validation**: Built-in validation for values (volume range, state values)
3. **Bulk Update Methods**: Convenience methods for updating multiple properties
4. **Command Handling**: Automatic routing of MQTT commands to callbacks

## Current Implementation Details

- **Discovery Config**: Automatic generation of Home Assistant discovery configuration

## Usage Example

Here's how to use the implemented MediaPlayer class:

```python
from ha_mqtt_discoverable import Settings, DeviceInfo
from ha_mqtt_discoverable.media_player import MediaPlayer, MediaPlayerInfo

# Create device and entity info
device_info = DeviceInfo(name="My Device", identifiers="my-device-id")

media_player_info = MediaPlayerInfo(
    name="My Media Player",
    unique_id="my-media-player",
    device=device_info,
    
    # Define supported features
    supports_play=True,
    supports_pause=True,
    supports_stop=True,
    supports_next_track=True,
    supports_previous_track=True,
    supports_volume_set=True,
    supports_seek=True,
)

# Create settings
settings = Settings(mqtt=mqtt_settings, entity=media_player_info)

# Define command callbacks
command_callbacks = {
    "play": handle_play_command,
    "pause": handle_pause_command,
    "stop": handle_stop_command,
    "next": handle_next_command,
    "previous": handle_previous_command,
    "volume_set": handle_volume_set_command,
    "seek": handle_seek_command,
}

# Create media player
media_player = MediaPlayer(settings, command_callbacks)

# Update state (simple)
media_player.set_state("playing")
media_player.set_title("Song Title")
media_player.set_artist("Artist Name")
media_player.set_volume(0.75)

# Update state (bulk)
media_player.update_media_info(
    title="Song Title",
    artist="Artist Name", 
    album="Album Name",
    duration=240,
    position=120
)
```

## Benefits Achieved

✅ **Implemented**: Proper capability discovery through feature flags  
✅ **Implemented**: Correct topic structure guaranteed

### 4. Improved Maintainability
✅ **Implemented**: Single source of truth for state in MediaPlayerInfo

- ✅ Complete property-based MediaPlayerInfo class
- ✅ Full-featured MediaPlayer class with state management methods
